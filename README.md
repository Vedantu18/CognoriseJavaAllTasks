NUMBER GUESSING GAME
Objective:

Player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.
Game Flow:

The game generates a random number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
The player is prompted to input their guess.
The game provides feedback:
If the guess is too high, inform the player that the guess is too high.
If the guess is too low, inform the player that the guess is too low.
If the guess is correct, congratulate the player and end the game.
Game Setup:

Initialize the random number generator.
Set the range for the random number (e.g., 1 to 100).
User Input:

Use Scanner class to read player input from the console.
Feedback Loop:

After each guess, provide feedback to guide the player.
Repeat the guessing process until the player guesses correctly.
Game Termination:

When the player guesses the correct number, display a congratulatory message.
Optionally, display the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
Prompt the player to play again or exit the game.
Error Handling:

Validate user input to ensure it is a valid number within the specified range.
Handle exceptions gracefully (e.g., non-numeric input).
Enhancements:

Allow customization of the range (e.g., user can set the lower and upper bounds).
Track the number of attempts and display it at the end.
Add a feature to limit the number of attempts and notify the player when attempts are exhausted.
Include a scoring system based on the number of attempts.
Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
